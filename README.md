# CSA Projects and Tasks Dashboard

***A lightweight Streamlit dashboard to visualize projects and tasks at a glance.***


### ❗The Problem
- CSA (the client) lacked a user-friendly way to track projects and tasks.
- ERPNext reports and exports existed, but weren’t easy to navigate → leading to low usability.
- CSA needed a simple interim solution until a full project management system could be adopted.

---

 
### ✅ The Solution
I built a demo **Streamlit dashboard** (for demonstration; not deployed to production) that:
- Displays projects + tasks in card layout.
- Highlights key details (status, start/end dates, priority).
- Uses static CSV datasets from ERPNext.


---


### 🌟 Impact
- Clear visibility into all open and closed projects.  
- Faster prioritization and easier decision-making.  
- Lightweight, intuitive design as a makeshift solution.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Streamlit  
- Pandas  
- CSV/ERPNext
