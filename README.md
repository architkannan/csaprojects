# CSA Projects and Tasks Dashboard

This demo dashboard was built with **Python** using Streamlit to track CSAâ€™s (client) projects and tasks. It provides a clear view of all projects (open and closed) along with their linked tasks, highlighting key details such as status, start date, end date, and priority.

To ensure the information can be absorbed easily at a glance, the dashboard uses a card-based layout for neatness and quick readability.

The dashboard uses static CSV datasets sourced from a dedicated ERPNext instance set up for CSA's projects. It was designed as a **makeshift solution** until a more robust platform for project and task tracking is adopted.
